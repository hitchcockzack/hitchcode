1. never suggest I run 'npm run dev'. I already have a server running.
2. ensure all components that you build and implement are compatible equally as well and display equally as clean and nicely on mobile AND desktop.
3. do not run npm run build unless I explicitly tell you, or if I give you an error log from a failed build.
